# Titanic Surival Prediction
## Predict Survival from disaster in Titanic

**Author**: SHAILESH_DHAMA

### Business Problem:

To build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data 
(i.e, name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

### Dataset : ./titanic_dataset.zip

## STEPS :

- Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning.
- Feature Engineering for train and test/validation dataset.
- Convert Objects to Category using Label Encoder for train and test/validation dataset.
- Discrete Variable Correlation by Survival.
- Graph distributions of quantitative data.
- Multi-variable Comparison graphically.
- Graph distribution of qualitative data : Pclass
- Graph distribution of qualitative data: Sex
- AxesSubplot for side-by-side data comparisons
- Plot distributions of age of passengers who survived or did not survive
- Histogram comparison of sex, class, and age by survival
- Correlation heatmap of complete dataset.
- Machine Learning Modelling
- Accuracy Report.
